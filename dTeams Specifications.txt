dTeams Construction Parameters:

Unset team variable should be assumed as neutral, and should therefore not qualify as an enemy under any circumstances,
	nor should they be counted as allies.

Targetting of enemy units should not be done by checking if the questioned unit is an ally, but rather that it is an enemy,
	this is to allow allow .
	Example:
		if(dTeams:isEnemy(self, target))then...
	Wrong:
		if not(dTeams:isAlly(self, target))then...

A team is composed of entities, and any entity within that team will return true on an isOnTeam() as well as isAlly() call,
	while isAlly will also return true on units in any team within the same alliance as the unit itself.
