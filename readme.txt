Lambda is a prospective Real Time Strategy gamemode for Garry's Mod, based on the 'War Melons: RTS' gamemode by Lap, which was itself a revision of MegaJohnny's 'War Melons'.
Key goals for Lambda which improve upon WM:RTS are improved collaboration between teams, advanced multi-unit control AI, and higher performance code.
